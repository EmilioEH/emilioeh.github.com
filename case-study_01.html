			<h1>Hi-Light</h1>

			<p class="subtext">Learning the Importance of Real-World Test</p>

			<p class="meta">Dec. 8th, 2018</p>

			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<P>I learned a lot with this project. I learned that I love the loop of iterating and testing. I learned that it’s incredibly gratifying to create something that I know works based on user feedback; but, The biggest lesson  is that my final design only worked inside the building; I didn’t follow Steve Blank’s advice to “get out of the building”to actually test. </P>

			<h3>Design Process</h3>

			<p>My Design Process. Pretty straightforward, and you can see that loop of iteration and feedback that I enjoyed.</p>

			<h3>The Biref</h3>

			<p>The brief was really just a set of features.  No reasons. No real problem. No users.</p>

			<h3>The Goal</h3>

			<p>My initial goal was following the brief. I went head first into sketching out some flows  for a tool to allow users to create a hi-light. Now, Tools aren’t innately bad, but initially I wasn’t even concerned with the why. Why did users need this?</p>

			<h3>User Scenario</h3>

			<p>So I conducted interviews in order to turn that list of features into a validated user problem with a user Scenario</p>

			<p>You’re listening to your favorite podcast and you hear something really interesting; like your whole life is different interesting. You try to take a mental note in hopes that you can share it with your friend so their life can be different too. The next day you see your friend and you try tell them about what you heard, but you don't remember the exact details; you don't even remember where you heard it.</p>

			<h3>The REAL Goal</h3>

			<p>With the scenario, I discovered that the REAL reason people want to create a hi-light. It’s to share interesting things with their friends in order to have a conversation. Meeting this goal would would create a REAL and compelling solution. Not just a tool.</p>

			<h3>Outcome</h3>

			<p>So yes… my final prototype solved the problem, but only in the building. (show the proto) In other words; it worked in a vacuum that is a usability test; you and the user in a room w/a device. But in my research I learned that that isn’t how my users actually listen to podcasts. They are usually doing something; exercise, driving, cleaning. The flow I created would require users to stop everything they are doing and walk step by step through my flow in order to achieve their goal. Now, I had a feeling from the beginning that the real way users would need to interact with this app would be with Voice UI, but it seemed like too huge of an undertaking. I was afraid to try something new.</p>

			<h2>Design Process | <small class="accent">Discover</small></h2>

			<h3>Target Users</h3>

			<p>The target users weren’t specified in the initial brief, but I knew it had to be people who listened to long form spoken word content. Yes that category is broad, but it served as a criteria for determining who to interview. Once i started interviewing users I realized that all of my users listened to podcast so I then had a more targeted user base. Podcast listeners</p>

			<h3>Persona VS Scenario</h3>

			<p>I created a user scenario because it gave context to the whole user experience: where they were, what they were doing, when they listen, why they listen and why they want to highlight. The specifics about the user that are generally part of a persona weren’t exactly valuable in solving this problem.</p>

			<h3>Key Quotes</h3>

			<p>These key quotes informed the REAL goal, the why</p>

			<h2>Design Process | <small class="accent">The Loop</small></h2>

			<h3>Sketches</h3>

			<h4>Cupcake</h4>

			<p>This was a sketch thinking out the rough idea of how the app would work. I used the term “Cupcake” to describe this sketch. The idea of a “Cupcake” comes from IBM. This is the metaphor: a cupcake is simple and small, but still delivers on the goods. In that same way this idea was simple and small but still delivers and solves the user’s need.</p>

			<h4>Wedding Cake</h4>

			<p>Here was a sketch including using Voice to prompt your app you create a highlight. Now I use the “Cake” metaphor again here. A wedding cake is increasingly more difficult than a cupcake, but also has tremendous value. This VUI flow has tremendous value, but is also a huge undertaking that i was scared at the time to tackle.</p>
