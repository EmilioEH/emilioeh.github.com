				<h2>Overview</h2> 

				<P>This was the first design project I’ve worked on with a team that had stakes. There was a client; NAMI Central Texas.</P>

				
				<h3>The Problem</h3>

				<p>What was the problem? Well, the NAMI team had a really deep understanding of their site and their users, because of this they pointed out two problems. 1) The website looked dated and 2) users had trouble using the site. They even had some hard data to support that. Users would call NAMI and ask for help with the site.</p>

				<h3>The Team</h3>

				<ol>
					<li>Janet</li>
					<li>Kristi Polozoff</li>
					<li>Osman Seyrek</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Research</h3>

				<p>What did our team do?  We wanted to validate the problem so we tested the navigation of the original site with a tree test and saw an overall success rate of 60%. But why? We conducted interviews and ran card sorting sessions to find out there are 2 reasons why: 1) Users didn’t understand the names of the classes, workshops, and support groups 2) Users couldn’t find specific things they were looking for on the site.</p>

				<h3>Design</h3>

				<p>Next, we designed a new navigation structure. In card sorting we learned that users organized content by who it was intended for. So that is how we decided to organize the site’s content.</p>

				<h3>Outcome</h3>

				<p>With another team I was able to run another Tree test with the new navigation. That study is still ongoing, but as of now we have seen an overall success rate of 86%.</p>

				<h2>Lessons</h2>

				<p>What I really want to share with you are the lessons I learned throughout this DESIGN project. I’ve worked on teams before, but I make the distinction of Design project because that’s the a major difference. The nature of Design vs business is that its a creative field and in some ways much more subjective. Because of that, Soft/professional skills came into play a lot more than I expected.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Logistics:
						<p>Working on project with so many moving parts and team members requires organization.</p></li>
					<li>Vital Decisions:
						<p>Realizing which decisions are life or death… or neither</p></li>
					<li>Team Communication:
						<p>Asking myself, “Is this the best way to ask this question?”</p></li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Logistics</h3>

				<p>This project was a big first step for me. There was a client, a 4 person team, research, designs, studys, work files… and more and more. I pretty quickly noticed the need for organization and more effective team communication.</p>

				<p>Here’s an example of that. Ok… yes it’s just a screenshot of a calendar event, but if you look closely there is a lot more. 1) The title tells me its a client meeting, so I should be prepared 2) There is a date and time, so I know when its happening 3) I see there is a remote meeting option and link or phone number to join, so I know if i don’t meet in person I should try to find a quiet place to join remotely.</p>

				<p>Why is all this important? Well, in other projects i’ve done, it was just me. I never created events. Why would I? No one else was joining. I had learned to work in an unorganized way.</p>

				<p>What’s the takeaway: It’s so easy to waste time by being confused or being unprepared, so I need to</p>

				<blockquote>

					<p>Stay organized and always be sure to communicate relevant details with the team.</p>

				</blockquote>

				<h3>Vital Decisions</h3>

				<p>On a team it’s important to determine which decisions are vital and which aren’t. In other words; Not every decision is life or death for the project. I have a tendency to make a decision and stick to it, but I realized that having that approach to every single decision isn’t the best for two reasons: 1) Obviously, I’m not always right; 2) Not every single decision is that vital.</p>

				<p>Here is an example. I designed the top example and I was determined that that was the only way it was going to look. Another team member designed an alternative. The bottom image, but I wouldn’t budge. Finally, at some point it clicked. This isn’t a vital decision. The other design isn’t wrong. It just wasn’t my idea. Let’s go with it.</p>

				<p>Generally speaking, If it doesn’t directly affect our user’s goal, then it isn’t vital. If it isn’t a vital decision and the other person’s idea isn’t clearly wrong then why stress over it?</p>

				<p>Big takeaway? Trust the team and move forward. The team has the best intentions at heart and they are just as passionate about this project as I am. Trust that they are doing what they think is best.</p>

				<blockquote>
					
					<p>Trust the team and move forward.</p>

				</blockquote>

				<h3>Team Communication</h3>

				<p>Ok, I’ll admit this lesson was a hard one learned. I stressed over this alot. I think the best way to talk about this is going straight into an example.</p>

				<p>Here is a slack message. NOTE to protect my own ego this is a fake message, but it still illustrates the point. At the start of the project I defaulted to slack for all communication. “Hey, I’m gonna use this slack thing so I can be cool and its just super easy.” What you see in the screenshot is an example of a message i sent early on. I’m asking for feedback, I sent an image of a design, and I asked for a ton of specific points and questions. The problem though is that, this is not the best way to have this conversation. After an intervention from the professor, here is what my messages turned into later in the project.</p>

				<p>It’s a simple request to jump on a call for a feedback session. With a link included.</p>

				<p>I thought Slack failed me in a major way, but I realized i hadn’t really asked myself if I was using it the right way.</p>

				<p>Here is the big takeaway:</p>

				<blockquote>
					
					<p>Be aware of what it is that you want to communicate to the team and the best medium to do so, not jsut the most convenient.</p>

				</blockquote>

				<h3>The REAL Goal</h3>

				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_conversation.jpg" class="case-study-image-with-caption" alt="People sitting at a table talking"/>

				<p class="meta image-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/u8rDR7cFrdM?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">rawpixel</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/people-talking?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></p>

				<p>My initial goal was to follow the brief. I went head first into sketching out some flows for a tool to allow users to create a highlight, just designing features. Now, tools aren’t innately bad, but I hadn’t even considered the why. Why did users need this?</p>

				<p>To answer this question, I conducted interviews and constructed a User Scenario. By doing this, I discovered the REAL reason people want to create a highlight: to share interesting things with their friends in order to have a conversation. Meeting this goal would would create a REAL and compelling solution, not just a tool.</p>

				

				<h2>Design Process</h2>

				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_design-process.png" alt="My Design Process" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

				<p>Before I started this project I outlined my general design process. Starting from this point gave me a high level idea of the flow of the project while remaining flexible. By keeping the schematic sort of intentionally vague, I gave myself some room to explore. In the sections below, I’ll show you a little bit more of what I did at each step.</p>

				<h3>Discover</h3>

				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_design-process_discover.png" alt="The Discover phase" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

				<h4>Target Users</h4>

				<p>The target users weren’t specified in the initial brief, but I knew they had to be people who listened to long form spoken word content. Yes, that category is broad, but it served as a criterion for who I would interview.  Talking to these users, I realized that they all listened to podcasts. I had discovered a more target user base: podcast listeners.</p>

				<h4>Interviews</h4>

				<p>Once I determined who the target users were I conducted three interviews. These were some of my first interviews as a designer. From these conversational investigations,  I pulled a few key quotes that really inspired my design.</p>

				<blockquote>

					<p>“...I’ll quote [a podcast] but I’ll quote it really poorly...I can’t ever remember where I heard it from. I’m not very confident…”</p>

				</blockquote>

				<cite>— User “K”</cite>

				<blockquote>

					<p>“...It was hard for me to articulate exactly what the episode was about... I couldn't do it justice by saying it...”</p>

				</blockquote>

				<cite>— User “A”</cite>

				<p>These key quotes informed the REAL goal, the why.</p>

				<h4>Persona VS Scenario</h4>

				<p>I chose to create a user scenario because it gave context to the whole user experience: where they were, what they were doing, when they listen, why they listen, and why they want to highlight. The specifics about the user that are generally part of a persona were less valuable in solving this problem.</p>

				<h4>User Scenario</h4>

				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_user-scenario.jpg" alt="Person lighting to iPhone" class="case-study-image-with-caption">

				<p class="meta image-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/u8rDR7cFrdM?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">rawpixel</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/people-talking?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></p>

				<p>I conducted interviews in order to turn that list of features into a validated user problem with a user scenario.</p>

				<p>You’re listening to your favorite podcast and you hear something really interesting; like your whole life is different interesting. You try to take a mental note in hopes that you can share it with your friend so their life can be different too. The next day you see your friend and you try tell them about what you heard, but you don't remember the exact details; you don't even remember where you heard it.</p>

				<h3>The Loop</h3>

				<p>In this phase of the design process I ideated and got feedback on those ideas.  My approach was to start pretty lo-fi and ramp up once I settled on a plan.</p>

				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_design-process_the-loop.png" alt="The Loop Phase" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

				<h4>Sketches</h4>

				<p>This was a sketch exploring the rough idea of how the app would work. I used the term “Cupcake” to describe this sketch. I borrowed this metaphor from IBM:  a cupcake is simple and small, but still delivers on the goods. Similarly,  this idea was simple and small but still delivers and solves the user’s need.</p>

				<p>Here was a sketch including using Voice to prompt the app to  create a highlight. The “Cake” metaphor is useful again here. A wedding cake is much more difficult to make than a cupcake, but also has tremendous value. This VUI flow has tremendous value, but was also a huge undertaking that I was scared at the time to tackle.</p>

				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_sketch_cupcake&weddingcake.png" alt="First Iteration Sketches" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">
				
				<h4>Prototyping</h4>

				<p>My first prototype didn’t consider the flow. By conducting usability tests, I learned that users were confused by what they were seeing. They needed more context. This helped me improve my subsequent designs.</p>
				
				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_prototype_overview.png" alt="Prototype Overview" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

				<h4>Usability Test | Feedback 01</h4>

				<p>Through usability testing I learned some valuable insights. This image represents a lesson in the value of context. On the left , you can see that my original design used blank label templates. As a result, users had no idea what they were even looking at. In my next iteration, I added real world data to give context.</p>

				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_prototype_feedback01.png" align="Feeback 01" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

				<h4>Usability Test | Feedback 02</h4>

				<p>From a usability perspective, users weren’t familiar with the new icons I used. It didn’t help that they weren’t labeled. Responding to user feedback, the icons are now labeled. </p>

				<img src="images/case-studies/hi-light/hi-light_prototype_feedback02.png" align="Feeback 02" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

				<h4>Usability Test | Feedback 03</h4>


				<p>Here, I presented my users with a flow and pattern that most weren't familiar with. I have some audio editing experience and I designed this screen, so I knew what was happening, but the users didn't. Their feedback helped me design a screen that was intuitive to all users.</p>

				<h2>Retrospective</h2>

				<h3>Outcome</h3>

				<p>So yes, my final prototype solved the problem, but only in the building. In other words; it worked in a vacuum that is a usability test; you and the user in a room with a device. But in my research I learned that that isn’t how my users actually listen to podcasts. They are usually doing something at the same time: exercising, driving, cleaning. The flow I created would require users to stop everything they are doing and walk step by step through my flow in order to achieve their goal. Now, I had a feeling from the beginning that the real way users would need to interact with this app would be with Voice UI, but it seemed like too huge of an undertaking. I was afraid to try something new.</p>

				<h3>Positives</h3>

				<ol>
					<li>The faster you can get an idea tested the better.</li>
					<li>Improve based on feedback, don’t feature add.</li>
					<li>Give relevant context. Use actual information and data not just placeholders.</li>
					<li>Be aware of the user’s knowledge of icons.</li>
					<li>Be aware of when you ask users to do something new.</li>
					<li>Test outside of the building. Go to where your users actually use the product.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Not So Positives</h3>

				<ol>
					<li>Don't design for yourself.</li>
					<li>Don’t exclude context in an effort to save time prototyping.</li>
					<li>Don't ignore the better solution because you’re afraid to try something new.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Next Steps</h3>

				<p>Sell it to the Apple Podcasts!</p>

				<p>Ok, realistically:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Implement Voice UI Screens.</li>
					<li>Tighten Up Visual Aspects.</li>
					<li>User test outside of the building.</li>
				</ol>
