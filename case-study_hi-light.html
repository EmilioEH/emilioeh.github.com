			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<P>Full disclosure, this was a class project at Austin Community College for User Interface 1. This project taught me some important lessons about both myself and the UX design process. I realized that I love the loop of iterating and testing. It’s incredibly gratifying to create something that I know works based on user feedback. The biggest lesson, however, was that I hadn’t followed Steve Blank’s advice to “get out of the building”to actually test. My final design only worked inside the building.</P>

			
			<h2>Problem Definition</h2>

			<h3>The Brief</h3>

			<img src="images/hi-light_book.jpg" alt="Book with sections highlighted." class="case-study-image-with-no-caption" />

			<p>Design an interaction flow that allows a user to do one or more of the following:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>“Highlight” audio, analogous to highlighting text in a book. What else can the user do now that they’ve highlighted the content?</li>
				<li>Listen to the book with other listeners around the world. Share your emotions on the content with the other listeners.</li>
				<li>Take notes on parts of the audiobook you find interesting.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Constraint: Work within the technical limitations of existing devices and features.</p>

			<h3>The REAL Goal</h3>

			<p>My initial goal was to follow the brief. I went head first into sketching out some flows for a tool to allow users to create a highlight, just designing features. Now, tools aren’t innately bad, but I hadn’t even considered the why. Why did users need this?</p>

			<p>To answer this question, I conducted interviews and constructed a User Scenario.By doing this, I discovered the REAL reason people want to create a highlight: to share interesting things with their friends in order to have a conversation. Meeting this goal would would create a REAL and compelling solution, not just a tool.</p>

			<h2>Design Process</h2>

			<img src="images/hi-light_design-process.png" alt="My Design Process" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

			<p>Before I started this project I outlined my general design process. Starting from this point gave me a high level idea of the flow of the project while remaining flexible. By keeping the schematic sort of intentionally vague, I gave myself some room to explore. In the sections below, I’ll show you a little bit more of what I did at each step.</p>

			<h3>Discover</h3>

			<img src="images/hi-light_design-process_discover.png" alt="The Discover phase" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

			<h4>Target Users</h4>

			<p>The target users weren’t specified in the initial brief, but I knew they had to be people who listened to long form spoken word content. Yes, that category is broad, but it served as a criterion for who I would interview.  Talking to these users, I realized that they all listened to podcasts. I had discovered a more target user base: podcast listeners.</p>

			<h4>Interviews</h4>

			<p>Once I determined who the target users were I conducted three interviews. These were some of my first interviews as a designer. From these conversational investigations,  I pulled a few key quotes that really inspired my design.</p>

			<p>“...I’ll quote [a podcast] but I’ll quote it really poorly...I can’t ever remember where I heard it from. I’m not very confident…”</p>

			<p>“...It was hard for me to articulate exactly what the episode was about... I couldn't do it justice by saying it...”</p>

			<p>These key quotes informed the REAL goal, the why.</p>

			<h4>Persona VS Scenario</h4>

			<p>I chose to create a user scenario because it gave context to the whole user experience: where they were, what they were doing, when they listen, why they listen, and why they want to highlight. The specifics about the user that are generally part of a persona were less valuable in solving this problem.</p>

			<h3>User Scenario</h3>

			<img src="images/hi-light_user-scenario.jpg" alt="Person lighting to iPhone" class="case-study-image-with-caption">

			<p class="meta image-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/u8rDR7cFrdM?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">rawpixel</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/people-talking?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

			<p>I conducted interviews in order to turn that list of features into a validated user problem with a user scenario.</p>

			<p>You’re listening to your favorite podcast and you hear something really interesting; like your whole life is different interesting. You try to take a mental note in hopes that you can share it with your friend so their life can be different too. The next day you see your friend and you try tell them about what you heard, but you don't remember the exact details; you don't even remember where you heard it.</p>

			<h3>The Loop</h3>

			<img src="images/hi-light_design-process_the-loop.png" alt="The Loop Phase" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

			<p>In this phase of the design process I ideated and got feedback on those ideas.  My approach was to start pretty lo-fi and ramp up once I settled on a plan.</p>

			<h4>Sketches</h4>

			<img src="images/hi-light_sketch_cupcake.jpg" alt="First Iteration Sketches" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">
			
			<p>This was a sketch exploring the rough idea of how the app would work. I used the term “Cupcake” to describe this sketch. I borrowed this metaphor from IBM:  a cupcake is simple and small, but still delivers on the goods. Similarly,  this idea was simple and small but still delivers and solves the user’s need.</p>

			<img src="images/hi-light_sketch_wedding-cake.jpg" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

			<p>Here was a sketch including using Voice to prompt the app to  create a highlight. The “Cake” metaphor is useful again here. A wedding cake is much more difficult to make than a cupcake, but also has tremendous value. This VUI flow has tremendous value, but was also a huge undertaking that I was scared at the time to tackle.</p>

			<h4>Prototyping</h4>

			<img src="images/hi-light_prototype_overview.png" alt="Prototype Overview" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

			<p>My first prototype didn’t consider the flow. By conducting usability tests, I learned that users were confused by what they were seeing. They needed more context. This helped me improve my subsequent designs.</p>

			<h4>Usability Test | Feedback 01</h4>

			<img src="images/hi-light_prototype_feedback01.png" align="Feeback 01" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

			<p>Through usability testing I learned some valuable insights. This image represents a lesson in the value of context. On the left , you can see that my original design used blank label templates. As a result, users had no idea what they were even looking at. In my next iteration, I added real world data to give context.</p>

			<h4>Usability Test | Feedback 02</h4>

			<img src="images/hi-light_prototype_feedback02.png" align="Feeback 02" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

			<p>From a usability perspective, users weren’t familiar with the new icons I used. It didn’t help that they weren’t labeled. Responding to user feedback, the icons are now labeled. </p>

			<h4>Usability Test | Feeback 03</h4>

			<img src="images/hi-light_prototype_feedback03.png" align="Feeback 03" class="case-study-image-with-no-caption">

			<p>Here, I presented my users with a flow and pattern that most weren't familiar with. I have some audio editing experience and I designed this screen, so I knew what was happening, but the users didn't. Their feedback helped me design a screen that was intuitive to all users.</p>

			<h2>Retrospective</h2>

			<h3>Outcome</h3>

			<p>So yes, my final prototype solved the problem, but only in the building. In other words; it worked in a vacuum that is a usability test; you and the user in a room with a device. But in my research I learned that that isn’t how my users actually listen to podcasts. They are usually doing something at the same time: exercising, driving, cleaning. The flow I created would require users to stop everything they are doing and walk step by step through my flow in order to achieve their goal. Now, I had a feeling from the beginning that the real way users would need to interact with this app would be with Voice UI, but it seemed like too huge of an undertaking. I was afraid to try something new.</p>

			<h3>Positives</h3>

			<p>The faster you can get an idea tested the better
			Improve based on feedback, don’t feature add
			give relevant context. Use actual information and data. Not just placeholders.
			be aware of user’s knowledge of icons.
			be aware of when your asking users to do something they haven’t done before
			test outside of the building. Go to where your users actually use the product.
			Big picture personal positive
			It’s incredibly gratifying to create something that I know works based on user feedback</p>

			<h3>Not So Positives</h3>

			<p>DON’T design for yourself
			DON’t  exclude context in an effort to save time prototyping
			DON’T: ignore the better solution because you’re afraid to try something new</p>

			<h3>Next Steps</h3>

			<p>Sell it to the Apple Podcasts
			Ok realistically,
			Implement Voice UI Screens
			Tighten Up Visual Aspects
			User test outside of the building</p>
